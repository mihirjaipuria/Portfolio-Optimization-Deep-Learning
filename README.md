# Advanced Stock Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive suite of tools for stock analysis, forecasting, and portfolio optimization. It combines machine learning techniques, Monte Carlo simulations, and traditional financial metrics to provide insights into stock behavior and optimal portfolio construction.

## Key Features

1. **Stock Price Forecasting**
   - Utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks for time series prediction
   - Implements feature engineering to enhance model performance
   - Employs Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization

2. **Portfolio Optimization via Monte Carlo Simulation**
   - Generates thousands of portfolio combinations
   - Calculates key metrics like Sharpe ratio, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
   - Identifies the optimal portfolio weights based on the highest Sharpe ratio

3. **Portfolio Backtesting**
   - Compares the optimized portfolio performance against the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)
   - Calculates various performance metrics including returns, volatility, alpha, and beta
   - Visualizes portfolio performance over time

## Usage

1. **Stock Price Forecasting**
   ```
   python stock_forecasting.py --symbol AAPL --start_date 2010-01-01 --end_date 2023-12-31
   ```

2. **Portfolio Optimization**
   ```
   python portfolio_optimization.py --input_file data/all_stocks_forecasts.csv --num_simulations 100000
   ```

3. **Portfolio Backtesting**
   ```
   python portfolio_backtesting.py --weights_file results/optimization/optimal_weights.json --start_date 2021-08-01 --end_date 2024-08-01
   ```

## Results

The project generates various outputs including:
- Forecasted stock prices (stored in `results/forecasts/`)
- Optimal portfolio weights (stored in `results/optimization/`)
- Performance metrics and comparison charts (stored in `results/backtesting/`)

## Customization

- Adjust the `num_simulations` parameter in `portfolio_optimization.py` to balance between accuracy and computation time.
- Modify the `features` list in `stock_forecasting.py` to experiment with different technical indicators.
- Change the `risk_free_rate` in `portfolio_backtesting.py` to reflect current market conditions.
